LWLab 4-way wire harness
========================

These are the SolidWorks files for the redesigned wire harness, which came from the original 3-way design. 

The main changes that have been implemented since that version are:

1. Stages 1-4 were widened by 0.5 inches to accomodate an additional PCI slot and SQUID card
2. Stages 2-3 were expanded vertically by 0.54 inches to give extra space for the 6.25 inch SQUID cards.

## Important parameters

The clearance between the inner diameter of the ISO200 port and stage 3 is `6.8 mm`

Refer to http://literator.colin.merkel.is/do7uO for calculations of the clearance for more than 4 cards.
