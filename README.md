LWLab 7-way wire harness
========================

Trying to combine the APEX/SPT style 7x wire harnesses with the HPD104. 

### Issues:

1. What is the minimum acceptable clearance between the ISO200 flange inner diameter and stage 3?
2. Can we avoid machining the existing wire harness?
3. Is the inner groove of the ISO200 outer k-style flange going to intersect with the o-ring?
4. Can we accommodate the distances between the planes in the SPT/APEX harness using our own parts?
5. Can we attach the DSUB feedthrough plate onto the outer flange without problems? Will the O-ring work, and will the RF shielding be OK?
6. Are we 100% confident that the inner diameter is 7.5’’ (or greater)?
7. Is the length of of the inner segment of the ISO200 entrance tube long enough to support the nose of stage 3?
8. Are the assumed SQUID card dimensions correct, or are they incorrect? And how are they incorrect?
